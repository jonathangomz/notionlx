**This is the prerelease of the app so I'm pretty sure that it have a few, maybe more, of bugs.**

## Manual Compilation and Usage

And it should be ready!

You may check the issues section to solve an issue and submit a PR. But maybe will be empty. But feel free to make your PR to the specific version (branch) of the app.
